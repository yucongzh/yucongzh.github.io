# Graph Anomaly Detection

## 1 Background

### History  
1. rely heavily on hand-crafted feature engineering
2. machine learning techniques, such as matrix factorization, SVM
3. Deep learning approaches



### Challenges  
1. How to effectively separate anomalies from normal objects through training remains
2. the interpretability of detected anomalies
3. high training cost
4. hyperparameter tuning



### Preliminaries  
- Plain graph
- Attributed graph
- Dynamic graph

$a \rightarrow b$
