## Mahalanobis Distance

> Mahalanobis distance is an effective multivariate distance metric that measures the distance between a point (vector) and a distribution.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D^{2}=(x-m)^{T}\cdot{C^{-1}}\cdot(x-m))  
where, 
- ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D^2) is the square of the Mahalanobis distance
- x is the vector of the observation (row in a dataset)
- m is the vector of mean values of independent variables (mean of each column)
- ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^{-1}) is the inverse covariance matrix of independent variables
